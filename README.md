# GUI-Calculator
# Calculator using Tkinter

This is a simple calculator application built using the Tkinter module in Python. The calculator provides a graphical user interface with buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), a decimal point (.), a clear button (C), and an equal button (=).

## Usage

1. **Numeric Buttons (0-9):** Click on these buttons to input the corresponding digit into the calculator expression.

2. **Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /):** Click on these buttons to input the corresponding arithmetic operator into the calculator expression.

3. **Clear Button (C):** Click on this button to clear the input and reset the calculator.

4. **Equal Button (=):** Click on this button to evaluate the expression and display the result.



## Features

- The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- It provides error handling for invalid expressions.
- The graphical user interface is created using Tkinter for easy interaction.
- if you click ** , you can perform the exponentiation operation.

## Code Overview

The code consists of functions for handling button clicks, clearing the input, and evaluating the expression. It uses the Tkinter library for creating the GUI, including an entry field for displaying the input and output, as well as buttons for each digit and operator.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included with most Python installations)

## Note

This calculator does not handle advanced mathematical functions or complex expressions. It is designed for basic arithmetic calculations.

Feel free to modify and extend the code according to your requirements or add more features to enhance its functionality.
